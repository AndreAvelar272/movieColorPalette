In a world of ubiquitous digital color grading, certain artistic choices can seem to be repeated
ad nauseam in blockbuster movies. Specifically, the orange and teal color palette is especially
prevalent in the industry. 
The goal of this notebook is to research this trend further. A sample of action movies from the past decade will be
taken and analyzed to find if there is a trend in the usage of specific color palettes.

To help us research this question further, I develop image analysis algorithms to extract dominant
colors in film frames. These will be part of a larger video analysis algorithm that will extract the
dominant colors of entire films.

Finally, these techniques will be applied to dozens of movie trailers to potentially find patterns in
color palette usage.

This repo includes the original notebook, the pdf version of the notebook, and a pdf version with all outputs created by the code. The frames and videos that were analyzed are not included due to size constraints.
